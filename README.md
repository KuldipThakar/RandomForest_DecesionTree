Random Forest
Random Forest is an ensemble machine learning algorithm that combines multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy and reduce overfitting. It works by:

Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregation): Randomly sampling data with replacement to train each tree.

Feature Randomness: Selecting a random subset of features for each tree split.

Voting/Averaging: Aggregating the predictions of all trees (majority vote for classification, average for regression).

Advantages:

Handles both classification and regression tasks.

Robust to overfitting due to averaging.

Can handle missing data and noisy datasets.

Applications:

Fraud detection, medical diagnosis, and recommendation systems.

Decision Tree
A Decision Tree is a supervised learning algorithm that splits data into subsets based on feature values, forming a tree-like structure. Each node represents a decision based on a feature, and the leaves represent the final output.

Key Concepts:

Splitting Criteria: Uses metrics like Gini Index, Entropy, or Information Gain to decide splits.

Recursive Partitioning: Divides data into smaller subsets until a stopping condition is met (e.g., max depth or minimum samples per leaf).

Advantages:

Easy to interpret and visualize.

Handles both numerical and categorical data.

Requires minimal data preprocessing.

Applications:
